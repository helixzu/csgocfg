Installing has never been easier, simply run the "winInstall.bat" and it will place all the neccercery files in the correct place.
Once in CS:GO, in console, type `exec /xzu/xzu.cfg`

# Usage

Most of the config is controlled via the console.
If the "sv_cheats" value is set to "1" it means the command will only work on servers that have it enabled, otherwise you may use the command anywhere.
